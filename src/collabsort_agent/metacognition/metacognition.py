    # Method used to compute decision confidence:
    # - "gap": normalized distance between winner/runner-up slowest accumulators.
    # - "bayesian": posterior probability that the winning action's drift truly exceeds the runner-up's.

    # The meaningful range/scale of this parameter depends on confidence_method:
    # - "bayesian": confidence is a calibrated posterior probability,
    #   so 0.5 = chance level and e.g. 0.75 is a reasonable target.
    # - "gap": confidence is an uncalibrated geometric measure whose scale
    #   depends on noise_std/theta; a lower target (e.g. 0.4) is appropriate.
    # - "qgap": 0.5 = tie between the chosen action and the best alternative.
    #   It does not depend on theta, so the controller has no direct influence on it.

    # - "td_error": outcome derived from the sign of the reward-prediction
    #   error (TD-error), i.e. whether the decision's consequence was at
    #   least as good as the agent's own prior expectation.
